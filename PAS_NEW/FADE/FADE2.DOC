      FADE2.PAS   -=-    Turbo Pascal Fading Routine    -=-    By Mike Schutz
                               November,  1994

            Allrighty, then.  Here's the Fade2 unit.  I've heard from
        several people, most of you requesting a TPU that supports TP 7.0,
        and a few requests for a fade in procedure.  Well, you're all set.

            Fade2 has the same old fade out routine that Fade.tpu had, but
        I've also thrown in GrabPal, Blackout, and FadeIn procedures, which
        are all used for a nice fading in effect.  Below is an explanation
        of each, along with the old stuff:

                PROCEDURE GrabPal;
                Syntax:  GrabPal;
                Purpose:  GrabPal stores the current palette into a
                          two-demensional array in the unit.

                PROCEDURE Blackout;
                Syntax:  Blackout;
                Purpose:  Blackout does exactally that.  Set's the whole
                          palette to 0, so the screen is black, even when
                          something "is there."

                PROCEDURE FadeIn;
                Syntax:  FadeIn;
                Purpose:  Must I really explain this?
            
                PROCEDURE FadeOut; 
                Syntax:  FadeOut;
                Purpose:  This should speak for itself as well.  The 
                          palette of the screen is sequentially adjusted 
                          towards zero.  The R, G, and B values are 
                          decremented until they reach zero.

                PROCEDURE ResetTextMode; 
                Syntax:  ResetTextMode;
                Purpose:  Resets to default text mode and palette.

            GrabPal and Blackout must be executed before FadeIn, respectively.
        FadeIn fades to the palette stored by GrabPal, and if you don't
        "Blackout," then FadeIn has nothing to do.

            FadeOut doesn't require you to call any procedures prior to it,
        because it manipulates from the palette instead of to it.

            If you ever do anything that blanks the screen, and you can't
        seem to correct it, just call ResetTextMode; -- That will always
        fix everything.

            I've again included an example file, called FADEDEMO.PAS.  Knock
        yourselves out.

        HEY, WAIT!
            Before I sign out, I'd like to thank Asphynxia for their tutorial
        series.  That's where I finally got this fade in thing.  I had my
        own that never wuite worked right, but then found a working procedure
        in their demo.  I just hope to make it easier now for those who just
        want the fade or whatever.

            If, for any odd reason, you want to contact me, try the following
        Internet email addresses.  I don't know where I'll be in the next
        year or two, so if one doesn't work, try the next:
                mschutz@gmu.edu
                mschutz@cap.gwu.edu
                mschutz@capaccess.org

        
        Enjoy yourself.
