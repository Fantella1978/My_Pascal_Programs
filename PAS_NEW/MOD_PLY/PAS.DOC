        USING THE SWMP DRIVERS WITH 'TURBO PASCAL 6.0'
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

         First of all you have to unzip the files of the included
        archive PAS_SDK.ZIP to a location where the pascal compiler can
        find them. This is either the directory where you keep your
        source code or even better the Turbo Pascal directory itself.
        The files you need in any case are:

              MODPLAY.TPU           : main unit
              MODPLAY.PAS           : source code
              DETECT.TPU            : fully automatic hardware detection
              SB_DRV.TPU            : SoundBlaster driver
              SBP_DRV.TPU           : SoundBlaster Pro driver
              GUS_DRV.TPU           : Gravis UltraSound driver

         The rest are example files, which can be important to
        understand things better. Now the only step to link all
        mod-procedures and functions is to add the following statements
        after your program heading:

              PROGRAM xxxxx;
              {$M $4000,0,0}        : This sets the heap size to zero
                                    : else the drivers cannot alloc memory
              USES ModPlay;         : include unit ModPlay
              ...
              ..

         At program start you have to initialize this unit using the
        following procedure:

旼횵NIT DRIVER컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Init(Driver,Port: WORD; IRQ,DMA: BYTE);
         -> Select and initialize driver for sound output

            Driver = Detection         (0) :  Port = 0
                                              IRQ  = 0
                                              DMA  = 0

                   = SoundBlaster      (1) :  Port = SB base address ($220..)
                                              IRQ  = SB IRQ#
                                              DMA  = 1 (always)

                   = SoundBlaster_Pro  (2) :  Port = SBP base address
                                              IRQ  = SBP IRQ#
                                              DMA  = SBP DMA channel

                   = Gravis_UltraSound (3) :  Port = GUS base address
                                              IRQ  = GF1 IRQ#
                                              DMA  = MIDI IRQ# !!


         A very powerful hardware detection is able to detect any
        supported soundcard with all required settings. So in general
        the easiest way to init the drivers is:

                MOD_Init(Detection,0,0,0);


         If all fails you can override detection and select one of the
        drivers by yourself, but in this case you have to know (or ask
        for) the settings of an installed soundcard.

         If you want to know if initialisation was successfull, have a
        look at the variable Soundcard (WORD), which will contain the
        output device:

              0:        no sound available
              1:        SoundBlaster            [ 22.2 kHz mono     ]
              2:        SoundBlaster Pro        [ 21.7 kHz stereo   ]
              3:        Gravis UltraSound       [ 44.1 kHz +stereo+ ]

         You do not have to handle this variable. You can also call the
        driver's subfunctions even if no soundcard was detected,
        nothing will happen in this case.

         At program end the unit selfrestores any altered interrupt
        vectors etc.

         The following functions & procedures are available:
        (Note: The first two procedures are enough to playback a mod !!!)

旼횸OAD MODULE컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Load(FileName: STRING);
         -> Stops possible sound output, loads module file into memory,
            but does no start playing. If successful the variable
            Channels (WORD) will contain the number of channels, else zero.

旼횾LAY MODULE컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Play(Looping: WORD);
         -> Starts playing previously loaded song. If looping is zero,
            song is played only once, else continuously.

旼훁TOP MODULE컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Stop;
         -> Stops sound output at once.

旼횺AIN VOLUME컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Volume(Volume: BYTE);
         -> Changes the driver's main volume setting. Valid values are
            between 0 (lowest) and 64 (loudest).

旼훁TATUS컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       FUNCTION Mod_Status: WORD;
         -> Returns 1 if sound is being played, else 0.

旼횳ET POSITION컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       FUNCTION Mod_Position: WORD;
         -> Returns 256*PatternNumber+LineNumber. Can be useful to
            syncronize a special graphic effect to the sound.

旼횶UMP BACK컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Rewind;
         -> Decreases current songposition. No effect in first pattern.

旼횶UMP FORWARD컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Forward;
         -> Increases current songposition. No effect in last pattern.


旼횾EAKS컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       PROCEDURE Mod_Peak(VAR Peaks);
         -> Updates the array Peaks by copying the driver's volume
            setting (0..64) of each channel. The number of channels
            can be found in the variable Channels (WORD) and is either
            four, six or eight.



         In general it remains to be said that you can do as much error
        checking as you like, but it is not necessary. In a demo or
        intro for example you do not care if there is sound available
        to the grafix you produce on the screen (in most cases). But in
        a player it is evident that you need to have any sounddevice at
        all to output the sound! The best way is to take a look at the
        example programs. Have a lot of fun!
